  This picture is of my sister Samantha. The dog is Lilly and she is an awesome companion. The man in the picture is my brother in law Josh.
  He is a sheriff in Florida and he is also on the swat team. They are a great family and plan to have kids in the near future. My sister teaches the fourth grade and tutors those that struggle in her class. She loves to work with kids and is a great person to get advice from. Currently she sits as the faculty leader of all the fourth grade teachers at her school. To give you an idea of what that means, she is leads 6+ teachers, by organizing the fundraisers and helping prioritize what is being taught in the curriculum.

  <div id="s2" style="display: none;">
  This is a picture of my sister Kimberly. The man by her side is her fiancé Nick. Nick is security guard for a local security contractor.
  He loves hockey more than I do and he is a great friend and loves much of the same things that I love to do. Kim is a secretary for a law firm, but her passion is with helping others. She is still trying to find what she really wants to do in life. She has thought about becoming a school consoler. Their wedding is planned for Summer of 2020 an I can’t wait for Nick to become part of our Family.

  <div id="s3" style="display: none;">
  This is a picture of my sister Stephanie. The man by her side is her boyfriend Phil. He is an insurance agent at a local health insurance company. He loves music video games and sports. Stephanie is a manager at national fuel and currently that position is the highest in the company before becoming a Chief Executive Office of a department. She loves to take pictures and tries to help anyone that needs help. A lot of times I will have her help me with my resume and my business attire. She loves to shop for closes and has excellent taste.

  <div id="p4" style="display: none;">
  My Parents. James is my father and boy is he a great man. He was a police office for 25+ years. He loves to play basketball and more than that he loves his family. My dad was a workaholic for most of his life putting in numerous hours of overtime as a cop and trying to make buffalo a better place for everyone. Michelle is my mother and she is probably the reason why I am who I am today. Since I can remember she has done as much in her life to make sure I have Succeeded in life. She would make dinner for my even if I was home late after, work or a hockey game. She would clean my room whenever she got a chance. Man if when was not so willingly to make my life easy as it is I am not sure I would still be pursuing a degree in computer science. This degree is very difficult and if my life was any more difficult than it is now I might have not been able to focus as much on school as I currently do.
