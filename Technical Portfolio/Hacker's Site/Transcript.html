<ul><li>CSE 250 "Data Structures"</li></ul><br>
This course was the basics of how data Structures work and what their time complexities are.
In this course c++ was the language used and many of the usual data structures were analyzed. Some of these include arrays, linked lists, double linked lists, Queue and Priority Queues.
<br>
<br>
<ul><li>CSE 331 "Intro to Algorithms Analysis"</li></ul><br>
This course went over the fundamentals of how to break down real world problems and implement them the most efficient way in software. Some of these strategies include Divide and Conquer, Sorting Algorithms, Search Trees, and Randomized Algorithms and Quicksort.
<br>
<br>
<ul><li>CSE 305 "Programming Languages"</li></ul><br>
This course went over the fundamentals of long term projects. The idea behind this course was to understand strategies on how to develop software so that in the future updates to it can be done easily. This included adding new features and fixing bugs. The long term project that was assigned was an interpreter. This was developed in python, and the main concept of the interpreter was to have a queue of commands that executed as soon as the user was done imputing commands. The interpreter would pop the queue and was expected to do many commands such as all basic computations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and squaring a number.
<br>
<br>
<ul><li>CSE 241/341 "Digital Systems/Computer Organization"</li></ul><br>
These courses went through the core concepts of machine level code. In 241 the major component of the course load was manipulation of machine level code. There was no major programing assignment besides developing code for a small all in one board that light up lights based on different button presses. In 341 the code development was larger component of the course load. The main project was developing a calculator in assembly level code. This project was assigned with checkpoints throughout the semester.
<br>
<br>
<ul><li>CSE 396 "Intro Theory of Computation"</li></ul><br>
This course went over the very fundamental ideas of how programing languages are made and what mathematical equations were developed in order to make programing a useful and productive tool to use in our daily lives.
<br>
<br>
<ul><li>CSE 306 "Software Quality in Practice"</li></ul><br>
This course is used to prepare students for programing in groups. There is a team project in which 4 students work to code different projects together as a team using github. There are also labs which the professor gives small codes bases in which the student is asked to add a feature of find and correct bugs. The use of gdb and other programs to find bugs are used to help the student find ways to locate and fix all the bugs in the program.
