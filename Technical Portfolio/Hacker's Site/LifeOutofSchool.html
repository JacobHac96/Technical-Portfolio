<!-- paragraph about images and life outside of school and work -->
<p>The Above slideshow shows you some of the stuff that I enjoy outside of work and school.
The main two sports I enjoy watching are Hockey and Football. My favorites Teams are the Buffalo Sabres and the Buffalo Bills.
Besides watching professional sports I also enjoy playing sports, and my favorite sport to play is Hockey. I used to play hockey for St. Mary’s Lancaster High School.<br>
The picture in in the above slide show is an old picture of when I use to play, the image was taken by a poor quality iPhone, which is why it appears to be pixelated.<br>
Aside from playing Hockey I do enjoy playing football, basketball and occasionally I play volleyball. In addition to sports I also really<br> enjoy longboarding. The image of the longboard in the slideshow is a board That I had my cousin custom paint. The of the board is a t.v.<br> show, "South Park". The board is a carving board, which means its smaller than most long boards to allow for quicker turns. <br>
I enjoy taking the long board to my cousin’s house in the town of Boston, New York. There are a ton of long hilly roads to ride and you can get a lot of speed riding on roads that have long and gradual declines.
